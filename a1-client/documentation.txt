The following document describes the usage and testing of a simple chat room
server and client.


The client is a Java program and the server is a C# program. All data stored in
the server is volatile as no database is used.


The client program can be run by executing the following commands in the src
directory within the a1-client directory:

Compilation:
    javac client/Client.java service/Service.java main/Main.java

Execution:
    java main.Main


The server program can be run by executing the following set of commands in the
src directory within the a1-server directory:

Execution:
    dotnet run


Finally, the client and program was tested by running each program and then
running through the various states of the program. Each of the commands were
tested when the user was not in a chat room, when the user was in a chat room,
when there were other users in the same chat room, and when a chat room was
lfull. Similarly, each of the commands were tested when there were and were not
messages within the current chat room and other existing chat rooms.
